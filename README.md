# BouncingBallz

## What is this?

This is a small game that simulates bouncing balls with as realistic physics and collisions as possible.

## Why?

The purpose is to test my skills in the game development space, specifically in game physics. Even though physics is already implemented in most game engines, I believe it's important to learn how physics works under the hood.

## What I learned?

After a week of studying and working on this project, I've learned the basics of physics in games. While there's still a lot to learn (such as fully grasping concepts like aerodynamic drag), I believe it's good progress for that period of time.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
